# a singleton class is a class that can have only one object 
(an instance of the class) at a time

Singleton's purpose is to control object creation, 
limiting the number of objects to only one

# So first restriction is imposed on constructor (by making it private)
# As this will limit obj creation from external classes, we need to have
an internal method, for object creation. Eg. getInstance
# The object should create a new object, iff no obj exists (or if cond is null)
# Also this method should be accessible to external classes (without obj creation)
and henceforth needs to be static.
