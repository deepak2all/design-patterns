USAGE:: Essentially used while building complex objects

PROBLEMS ADDRESSED::
For building a complex object, we generally have multiple args in its constructor,
which potentially causes the below problems
a) Programmer needs to remember the args and supply values accordingly
b) At times, not all args are needed; but still programmer needs to key in "null" as values,
for those arguments

IMPLEMENTATION OF BUILDER PATTERN::
Assuming Phone is the complex object (with many instance variables) that needs to be built, 
using builder pattern,
we come up with a builder object called PhoneBuilder such that
(a) It has a constructor with args that represents the bare minimum mandatory fields
(b) The rest all are managed using setters such that all the setters would
		1) "return this" unanimously and
		2) the return type of setters would be the "builder object" instead of void
(c) It has one "final" method that doesn't take any inputs; however returns the complex object.
	NOTE:: 
	This method's complex object would have the same argument list as that of the constructor
	of the complex object, i.e. in essence all the components have to be returned
(d) The original complex object (although it's not used by other classes directly for object
    building)
(e) By the rule of thumb, it'd be preferred to set the fields used in the PhoneBuilder's 
	constructor as "final"
(f) The classes which intend to build complex object essentially makes use of new Builder class,
	by supplying the mandatory args via constructor and other optional args through the setters
	and finally calling the final method of the builder (which returns the complex object)
	NOTE:: All these things happen with just one line of code ...

EXAMPLE
=======
PhoneShop.java makes use of PhoneBuilder2.java, to build Phone object.
The mandatory fields are os, processor and battery.
The optional fields are screenSize and camera.
getPhoneFromPhoneBuilder2 is the final method in PhoneBuilder2.java, used to construct
complex object Phone.

The one liner used for building complex object (inside PhoneShop.java) is

Phone phUsingBuilder2 = new PhoneBuilder2("Android", "SnapDragon", 2100)
								.setScreenSize(5.5).setCamera(20)
								.getPhoneFromPhoneBuilder2();
