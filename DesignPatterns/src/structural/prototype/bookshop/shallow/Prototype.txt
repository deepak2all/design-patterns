Prototype:
Used whenever obj creation takes a lot of time (or)
utilizes lot of memory

Eg. Object creation requires fetching data from database

Generally, this is done using CLONING.

CLONING is of 2 types
	# SHALLOW CLONING : There is only one object created by there are multiple references pointing to the 
						same object
	# DEEP CLONING : There are multiple new objects created from the existing object


Disadvantages of shallow cloning / shallow copy
================================================
Whenever the primary object is changed, all the new objects created via references will also have this change,
as they all in turn point to the same object

This problem can be solved by using DEEP CLONING or DEEP COPY
