Pirates are coming and our captain needs to escape but there is only fishing boat available. 
We need to create an adapter that allows the captain to operate the fishing boat with his rowing boat skills.

Now the Captain can use the FishingBoat to escape the pirates
Captain captain = new Captain(new BoatAdapter());
captain.row();

Captain uses BoatAdapter which helps in transforming FishingBoat to a RowingBoat
