
1. FACTORY PATTERN vs PROTOTYPE PATTERN
	Normally, we always use "FACTORY PATTERN" for object creation.
	However, there are some objects whose creation takes more time or consumes a lot of memory.
	Eg. Object creation which requires data from database
	Only for creation of such objects, "PROTOTYPE PATTERN" needs to be used.
	
2. BUILDER PATTERN vs COMPOSITE PATTERN vs DECORATOR PATTERN
	BUILDER PATTERN is used for creation of ONE COMPLEX OBJECT, which is made up of multiple parts.
	These parts generally don't belong to any other class but is part of the ORIGINAL object itself.
	Also since these parts aren't separate objects, there won't be any possibility of having any other
	sub-object; so there won't be any tree-structure hierarchy, involved in the object creation.
	COMPOSITE PATTERN is used for building of ONE COMPLEX OBJECT, which in turn comprises of several
	SIMPLE OBJECTS, forming a tree-structure hierarchy. 
	DECORATOR PATTERN is building some additional featured on the existing PRIMARY OBJECT, by appending it with
	several SECONDARY OBJECTS.
	These SECONDARY OBJECTS's features can be utilized by any number of PRIMARY OBJECTS, which is in need to append
	these features, with it's existing features.
